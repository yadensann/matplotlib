## Pymaceuticals Inc.

#### Pymaceuticals Inc. is a pharmaceutical company specializing in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. They've begun screening mice for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

### Summary of study results 
##### Generated a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

### Bar Plot
##### Generated bar plots with Pandas by making a dataframe and using 'DataFrame.plot()' and also using Matplotlib's 'pyplot' function. Each plot shows the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the study.

### Pie Plot
##### Generated pie plots with Pandas by making a dataframe and using 'DataFrame.plot()' and also using Matplotlib's 'pyplot' function. Each plot shows the distribution of female to male mice in the study.

##### - Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across the top four treatment regimens. Calculated the quartiles, IQR, and determined the potential outliers.

##### - Selected a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generated a line plot of its Tumor Volume versus TimePoint.

##### - Generated a scatter plot of the mouse weight versus the average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment regimen.

##### - Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for Capomulin treatment. Used this information to plot a linear regression model.
